My personal portfolio website [deployed to Netlify](https://snoutibur.netlify.app/) that features artwork, music, my programming projects, and freebies!

## TODO
This project is currently WIP.

Most of the content from my old site (snoutibur.github.io) has been transferred over except for Discography. I haven't gotten Markdown â†’ astro page working yet.

There's a lot of new content I need to add, notably
- CS projects
- Artworks

and possibly
- about me
- gear collection
